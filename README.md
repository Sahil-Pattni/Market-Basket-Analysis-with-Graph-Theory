# Fourth Year Dissertation

This is my fourth year dissertation repository. The goal of this paper is to further research the field of Market Basket Research (MBA), with the use of Minimum Spanning Trees. 

### Paper
The pdf and the .tex files can be found under the `LaTeX` folder. 

### Code
The code can be found under the `code` folder. Currently, all the code is written in Python3, but the files are in the `iPython Notebook (.ipynb)` format, and therefore you will need the Jupyter Notebook package installed to run it.

Alternatively, you can run the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab for free.

### Data Sources
The data I use is the sales data from a chain of Brazilian gas-station stores, available [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marcio486/sales-data-for-a-chain-of-brazilian-stores).

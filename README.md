# Market Basket Analysis with Graph Theory
This is my fourth year dissertation repository. The goal of this paper is to introduce the Clustered-Graph Rule Generation (CGRG) algorithm, which extracts multi-class association rules from a transactional database by leveraging the use of Minimum Spanning Trees and Markov Clustering.
### Paper
The pdf and the .tex files can be found under the `LaTeX` folder. 

### Code
The code can be found under the `code` folder. Currently, all the code is written in Python3, but the files are in the `iPython Notebook (.ipynb)` format, and therefore you will need the Jupyter Notebook package installed to run it.

Alternatively, you can run the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab for free.

### Data Sources
The data I use is the sales data from a chain of Brazilian gas-station stores, available [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marcio486/sales-data-for-a-chain-of-brazilian-stores).

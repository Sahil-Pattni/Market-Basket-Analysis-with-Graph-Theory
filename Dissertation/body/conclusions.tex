\chapter{Conclusions}
\section{Achievements}
In this paper, we have introduced a new algorithm for association rule generation - the \algo\ algorithm: an extension of the methodology proposed by \pcite{mst_paper} that also employs the techniques and principles outlined in \pcite{apriori} and \pcite{markov_clustering}. The \algo\ algorithm produces bi-cluster rules where the antecedent and consequent are from separate clusters, and intra-cluster rules where both the antecedent and consequent originate from the same cluster. In doing so, it appears to capture the high-support rules from all possible rules within any support and confidence constraints.  We have also theorized that association rules that are bi-cluster or intra-cluster tend to have a higher support score than those rules that are not. The rules generated by the \algo\ algorithm seem to also follow general intuition (see: Table \ref{tab:arm_rules}) such as \texttt{\{cigarettes\}} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{\{chewing gum and candy\}}, and \texttt{\{filters\}} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{\{lubricant}\}, further reinforced by their existence in the rules generated by the Apriori algorithm as well.

\section{Limitations}
\textbf{Dataset Bias}\\
All analysis was conducted on the topological structures generated from a singular dataset. This may not be wholly representative of the rules the \algo\ algorithm may generate, and perhaps a different dataset may have yielded different results.
\\\textbf{Clustering}\\
As seen in Figure \ref{fig:cluster_named} on Page \pageref{fig:cluster_named}, the Markov Clustering configuration yielded some clusters that seem appropriate, yet some (for example, the largest) were perhaps too broad to classify under a single cluster. This is because the clustering algorithm has no knowledge of the product's subcategories or parent categories, it only isolates dense regions within the MST, identifying each of these dense regions as a distinct cluster.
\\\textbf{Rule Structure}\\
The \algo\ algorithm's key feature is both its greatest strength and drawback. Due to the fact that our algorithm only selects those rules where the items in a given itemset are from the same cluster, the algorithm overlooks rules where the antecedent and consequent have a composition of items from multiple clusters. 
Figures \ref{fig:rule_support} and \ref{fig:rule_lift} indicate that the \algo\ algorithm did not generate several higher-value rules present at the elbow of the Apriori rule curve.
However, we have also concluded via Figure \ref{fig:rule_support} that this constraint captures a majority of high-value (i.e. high support) rules and does not capture the lower-value rules within the support and confidence constraints.
\\\textbf{Rule Value}\\
One of the purposes for this project was to introduce an algorithm that would produce fewer rules than the Apriori Algorithm, albeit of higher value. To this end, we have partially succeeded, the \algo\ algorithm only produced ~$15\%$ of the rules present in the Apriori ruleset with the same constraints. However, as stated in \pcite{market_ass}, the \textit{"interestingness"} of a rule cannot be truly formalized, and therefore subjective human feedback is required to further reduce the ruleset to only those rules that can be considered actionable and/or valuable.


\section{Future Works}
Future projects based on this work may consider building the graphs based on individual products instead of the product categories used in this project. As mentioned, a key limitation of our analysis is that it only applies to the dataset we used. Future projects involving different datasets may produce new insights into the advantages and/or limitations of the algorithm. Additionally, alternative clustering algorithms may be considered as a replacement for the Markov Clustering algorithm. The clustering need not be of the graph itself, machine learning classifiers or classifiers could be build such that the products or product categories could be segmented into broader categories, with no relation to their topological location on the graph. Lastly, the validation and isolation of import rules by human test subjects could augment the algorithm to produce an even smaller ruleset of much higher value.
